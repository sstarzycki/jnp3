Sorcerers are not invited to the event. Even if it is beautiful. This was precisely 

the problem. 

I do not care, she thought Kaitlyn. I do not need anyone. 

Just sat and listened to the story, as Marcy Sasseen Huang and Pam plan a party. It was hard not to hear them: quiet, apologetic voice of Mr. Flynn could not compete with excited whispers. Kaita pretended not to hear anything, and just dreamed about it, to escape. She could not, so she began to scribble in a notebook history. 

Flashed her conflicting feelings. She hated Pam and Marcy, and she wished them to death, or at least some terrible accident which mangled wyszłyby, defeated and unhappy. And while she felt a great longing. If only they gave it a chance and allowed to enter the circle. Finally, do not insist to be the most popular and most admired girl in school. Would satisfy their own place in the group. And they were turning their heads and say, "Oh, that Kaitlyn is such a strange, but what we have done without it?" That's quite enough to just be able to belong somewhere. But it never will be. Marcy never invite her to a party , it never even comes to mind. Witch is overlooked: no one even guessed that Kaitlyn, a beautiful, mysterious girl with strange eyes, would want to go anywhere. I do not care, she thought Kaitlyn, returning to the starting point. It my last year. Just one more semester. After I finish high school and I hope that I had never meet these people. 

But it was another problem. In such a small town as the thoroughfare will be seeing 

both colleagues and their parents every day for the next year. And then another and another ... 

There was no escape. If she could go to college, all have turned out differently. But it misses the opportunity for artistic scholarship ... Besides, he was still a father. He needed her and did not have money. Or secondary school, or nothing. 

Imagined the next few years spent in the cold school halls that seemed so grim it visible through the window like a winter landscape of Ohio. So will always sit and listen as girls are planning another event, which will never be invited. Forever excluded. I will always suffer, regretting that there is a real witch, then you could throw at them a horrible, painful and muddling charm. 

When we meditate, drew all the time. Or rather, moved her hand, perhaps he did not mind 

in this part. She glanced at the paper and first saw his picture. Cobweb. But the strangest thing was what was underneath, very close, almost on your doorstep. The eyes. 

Wide open, round eyes, hidden behind long eyelashes. As with deer Bambi. These were the eyes of a child. 

She looked at the picture and felt that it begins to spin in his head, as if dropped down and figure pulled her inside. The feeling was terrible, but familiar. She felt the same thing every time he drew one of these drawings. It gained the nickname by no witch. And for this to fulfill. 

Violently pushed back, feeling that makes her sick. I beg, no, she thought. Not today and not here, not in school. It's just meaningless scribble. 

Please, let it be just scribbles. 

Icy coldness gripped her as if her body, completely ignoring the mind, szykowało on what was to come. 

The child. Drew the eyes of a child, so a child was in danger. But what kid? Looking at the paper, Kaita felt a sudden spasm in his hand. Podpowiadały her fingers, which should draw. A small semicircle on the side. Upturned nose. Then the large, filled circle. Face, the open for fear of pain or surprise. A large bow at the chin. 

A few strokes the hair, then a sudden itch disappeared. Released air. 

That's all. The child in the picture had to be a girl with hair storm. Curly hair. Pretty girl with cobwebs on his face. 

Something would happen and it was about this small and spider. But where and to whom? When? Today? In a week? In the next year? 

It is not enough. 

Never enough. It was just the worst in that its a terrible gift. Drawings are very accurate and always, always, is checked the. Soon, something will happen, which drew on paper. 

But I do not know when. 

What did she do now? Run around town with a megaphone to warn young girls against spiders? Go down to the elementary school and look for a small with curly hair? Even if she tried to do it and so everyone would have fled from it. As if she caused the events that occurred in the drawings. If it were her fault, and she's just predicted it. 

The contours of the image began to blur. Kaitlyn blinked. Certainly will not cry. I never cried. 

Never. Not once, at least from the time when she was eight years old and her mother died. Since then, she could stop the tears. 

Suddenly, in the class had become confusion. Mr. Flynn's voice, usually so quiet and melodious that students could easily take a nap, suddenly fell silent. Chris Barnabas, the boy who was on duty today, brought to the room a pink card. The call. 

Kaitlyn watched as the teacher takes the piece of hand, reads it, and gentle eyes water after class, wrinkling his nose at the same time to improve his glasses. 

- Kaitlyn, your director asks you. 

Kaitlyn reached for the book. She walked the aisles, upright with his head raised high. Card read: "Kaitlyn Fairchild's office urgently summoned to the headmistress!" Word 

"Urgent" gave a piece of slightly sinister character. 

- What, again wpakowałaś in trouble? - Said a mocking voice from the first row. Kaitlyn had no idea who it is said, but did not intend to reverse. She went with Chris on the outside. 

meadows, once again in trouble, she thought, heading towards the office. About this time what it was? The excuse that his father "signed" last fall? Kaitlyn leave a lot, because sometimes everything was quite warm. When it was getting 

really bad, she walked down the street towards Piau rural farms and began to draw, lam no one bothered her. 

- I'm sorry that you are in trouble - he threw Chris Barnabas, when they reached the office. - I mean ... if you are in trouble. 

Kaitlyn froze him with her eyes. He seemed to be in order: shiny hair, soft eyes, a little 

as Hello Sailor, cocker spaniel, which was many years ago. But he never gave the 

fooled. 

The boys were good for nothing. Kaita knew perfectly well why they were so nice to her. After his mother inherited a creamy Irish complexion and fiery hair and supple and slender figure. But at least her eyes were their own, and at that point decided to exploit them ruthlessly. Chris looked straight in the face. 

Boy did the pale. 

A typical reaction of people who looked into her eyes. They were dark blue with dark spots in the middle and black-ringed around the irises. 

My father said that was fine and was marked by the fairies. But people knew her. Since the memory reached, everyone around whispering that her eyes are weird and bad. They saw what they should not see. 

Sometimes, as at this moment, Kaitlyn had used them as weapons. As long stared at Chris, until finally the poor man stepped back. Then he lowered her lashes and came humbly to the Cabinet. She felt sick satisfaction, but only for a moment. In the end, it is no stunt scare 

cocker spaniel. Sam was too frightened and unhappy to worry about. The secretary pointed out her hand to his office door. Kaitlyn prepared for the worst. Director McCasslan was not alone. Next to her sat a tanned young woman with short blond hair. 

- Congratulations - she said the fair-haired woman. A quick and graceful movement rose from the chair. 

Kaitlyn was in the place of his head raised high. She did not know what to think about it. But the next moment a strange feeling came over her. 

This is it. For it is waiting for. 

Not only she knew that something was waiting. 

Of course it is. And it is precisely this moment. 

The next minute your life is changing. 

- My name is Joyce - blonde introduced herself. - Joyce Piper. Do not remember me? 

Chapter 2 

Woman seemed familiar. Shiny blond hair to fit her head like wet fur seals, and her eyes were an unusual shade akwamarynowy. She was wearing an elegant pink costume, but moved with grace fitness instructor. Kaitlyn suddenly remembered something. 

- Test your eyes! Joyce shook her head. 

- Exactly! - She replied excitedly. - So what do you remember? 

Kaitlyn looked in amazement at Mrs. McCasslan. Director, low, plump, but very pretty woman, put his hands on the desk. She looked calm, but her eyes sparkled. Okay, so I'm not in trouble, she thought Kaita. But what's going on? Standing in the middle of the room with an uncertain look on his face. 

- Do not be afraid, Kaitlyn - said Mrs. McCasslan. Waved in the air, a small hand with a large number of rings. - Sit down. 

Kaita sat down. - 

- Do not bite - added Joyce. I myself sat down, not for a moment taking his eyes from the Kaita. 

- Well, what zapamiętałaś? 

- It was a simple test, as in optics - Kaitlyn she said slowly. - I thought about a new program. 

All testing their new programs here. Apparently, Ohio was a state representative so that its inhabitants were the ideal guinea pigs. Joyce smiled slightly. 

- Because it was a new program. But really it was not for us to test vision. Remember this test, in which you had to write down the letters that you saw? 

- Eee ... Yes. - It was hard to remember anything, because everything that happened then, enveloped in the fog. That was last fall, somewhere in early October, she thought Kaita. Joyce came to the hall and talked to her class. It remembers. She asked them to cooperate, and then showed them some "relaxation exercises", followed by Kaitlyn felt relaxed. - She gave us your pencils and paper - Kaita hesitated. - And then on the screen appeared the letters that were doing less and less. I could barely write - she added. - I was all numb. 

- It's just hypnosis, that you got rid of inhibitions - Joyce explained, leaning forward. - What's Next? 

- I wrote another letter. 

- That's right - agreed to Joyce. On its face tanned smile appeared. - It is impossible to 

to hide. 

- So I have good eyesight? - She asked after a moment Kaita. 

- I do not know. - Joyce sat up, and the smile never left her face. - Want to know how it really looked like, Kaitlyn? We showed you a smaller and smaller letters until 

in the end they were not there at all. 

- Amiga? 

- Not for the last two slides. There were only a formless dots, and even if you 

had a sharp eye, and so you would not see anything. 

Kaitlyn felt a cold chill on my back. 

- But I saw the letter - she insisted. 

- I know. But not the eyes. 

In the room there was complete silence. Kailtyn she felt her heart pounding wildly.

- In the room next to someone he was - explained Joyce. - The student, with excellent concentration, and he watched tablicom of letters. That is why you saw them, Kaita. His eyes. Waited for the next letter, so you had an open mind and you saw what he did. 

- But it does not work that way - Kaitlyn said quietly. Only it does not ... Just not another cursed gift. 

- I think so. This is the same - said Joyce. - It's called remote viewing. The consciousness of something beyond our ordinary senses .. Your drawings are also 

extrasensory perception example, it events, sometimes those that are not yet occurred. 

- How do you know about my drawings? - Kaita felt a strong surge of emotion, who immediately placed it on his feet. It's not fair: some stranger comes and plays with her cat and mouse, test, cheating, and in addition, says 

0's private drawings. It was a very personal drawings 

1, even people in the thoroughfare had the decency to not mention them. 

- I'll tell you what I know - Joyce continued. She spoke quietly, rhythmic voice, intensely staring at Kaitlyn. - I know that for the first time did you discover your gift, when you were nine years old. In your area disappeared when a small boy ... 

- Danny Lindenmayer - quickly interjected director. 

- Danny Lindenmayer - Joyce repeated, not taking his eyes from the Kaita. - Police knocking from door to door looking for him. When your father is talking with them, you just rysowałaś. Sly-hut, which spoke of a lost boy. And when you're done, you saw the drawing, which you could not understand. Narysowałaś trees, bridge ... and something square. Kaitlyn nodded resignedly. The memory did not give her peace and she felt that it begins to spin in my head. She remembered her first drawing, so dark and strange. Then she felt fear ... She knew that her fingers narysowały something very wrong, but did not know why. 

- And the next day you saw on TV where the boy's body was found - said Joyce. - Under the bridge, near the trees ... in the chest. 

- The square thing - she said Kaitlyn. 

- It is perfectly matched to your drawing, even though you had no idea about this place. The bridge was situated on a forty-five km and was located in the town, where ever you were. When the father saw the news, immediately 

recognize your drawing and was very excited. He began to show and tell him the whole 

the story. But people do not react too well. Already believed that you are strange because of your eyes. But it was something completely different. I do not like them. And when things started to repeat, and your drawings proved to be prophetic, people were terrified. 

- And now Kaitlyn has some difficulty in dealing with other people - the director interjected gently. - By nature a rebel, and this annoys quickly. She also 

irritable and chilly. It's probably self-defense. - Director shook his head. Kaitlyn looked at her with anger, but her gaze did not have the power itself. Calm, pleasant voice Joyce completely disarmed her. Again she sat down. 

- So now you all already know about me - she said to Joyce. - I have a problem in dealing with people, so ... 

- You do not have any problem - interrupted her Joyce. She seemed shocked. She leaned 

and added: - You have a tremendous gift. You do not understand this, Kaitlyn? You do not realize what you're amazing and wonderful? 

From what I know Kaitlyn, unusual does not mean wonderful. 

- The world is just a handful of people who can do what you - said Joyce. - In the entire United States found only five. 

- Five? 

- Five students from the last class of high school. Five kids. Of course each of you has a different talent, you can not do the same. But this is just great. That's what we were looking for. We will be able to perform a series of experiments. 

- You want me to experiment? - Kaitlyn looked at the headmistress. 

- Gone too far up. Let me explain you everything. I came from San Carlos, California ... 

It's at least explained tan. 

- ... And I work at the Institute of Zetes. This is a very small lab, not the same as in SRI * or at Duke University. It was established last year with the Foundation's scholarship Zetes. Mr. Zetes is ... Oh, what can I say about him? It's an amazing man. Is president of a large corporation in Silicon Valley. But really, his greatest passion is supernatural. Psychical research. 

Joyce interrupted, pushing aside the bright strands of shiny forehead. Kaitlyn wanted to tell her something really important. 

- He put the funds into a special, very complicated project. He got the idea to organize a nationwide study in schools and look for students with supernatural abilities. I find five or six of the best who are the real 

cream, and bring them to California for the annual survey. 

- Yearly? 

- This is the most beautiful, do not you understand? Instead of a few sporadic tests, you might explore every day at regular times. We could change your skills with biorhythms, diet ... - Joyce suddenly stopped. Kaita watched carefully and grabbed her by the hand. - Kaitlyn, lower their walls and listen to me for a while. You can do this? 

Kaita felt her hands begin to tremble in the cold embrace of fair-haired woman. Swallowed loudly, unable to tear my eyes away from her eyes akwamarynowych. 

- Kaitlyn, did not come here to hurt you. I admire you very much. You are blessed with a wonderful gift. I want to explore it. All my life was preparing for such research. I finished Duke University, you know, where the Rhine was running his telepathic experiments. I did a degree in parapsychology, I worked at the Maimonides Dream Laboratory, the Mind Science Foundation in San Antonio and in the laboratory for 

paranormal investigation at Princeton. All the time I dreamed of such a facility like you. Together, we can prove that what you are doing is real. We find the scientific arguments and prove the world that ESP really exists. She paused, and Kaitlyn heard noise from the room next to the printer. 

- They are also including some benefits for you, Kaitlyn - said the lady McCasslan. - I think you should explain it, what are the conditions. 

- Yes. - Kaitlyn Joyce let go of his hand and lifted from the desktop folder. - You went to a very good school in San Car-los, to finish the last class. During this time, dwell in the Institute of the remaining four, we have chosen. Every afternoon, we will carry out tests, but they do not take you much time, at most an hour or two. And at the end of the year receive a scholarship to the college of his choice. 

- Joyce opened the folder and handed it to Kaitlyn. - A very generous scholarship.

- Extremely generous scholarship - added Mrs. McCasslan. Kaitlyn looked at the number of 

visible on the sheet. 

- It's ... for all of us, right? To share? 

- This is for you - said Joyce. - Only for you. Kaitlyn felt that shakes her head. 

- You will work for the good of science - urged Joyce. 

- Finally, start a new life. None of your new school does not need to know why you are there. You can be ordinary high school student. And in the autumn will be able to go to college at Stanford or the University of San Francisco. San Carlos is only a half hour drive from San Francisco. And then you'll be free. 

Kaitlyn felt that really shakes her head. 

- You'll love the bay. The sun, nice beaches. You know that yesterday when I traveled, there were more than twenty degrees? And this winter. Redwoods, palms ... 

- I can not - she said quietly, Kaitlyn. 

Joyce and the director looked at her in amazement. 

- I can not - repeat loudly Kaita, hiding behind the inner wall. She felt that otherwise would be the vision that unfolded before her Joyce. 

* SRI - one of the most famous scientific centers in the world, founded in 1946 as Stanford Research Institute, Stanford University (handedly.). 

- Do not want to get out? - Joyce asked quietly. 

Do not want to? And that's how. Sometimes she felt like a bird striking its wings against the window. Although not quite know what to do if she managed to finally get out of here. But it had to be 

any place where would feel at home. Place to which to fit. I never thought that California might be such a place. It seemed to be too rich, exciting and thrilling. It was like a dream. And the dough ... 

But the father. 

- Nothing you do not understand. It's about my father. Do not be parting with it, at least since the death of my mother. He needs me. It is not ... He really needs me. Mrs. McCasslan looked at her with compassion. She obviously knew her dad. Once was 

outstanding professor of philosophy, he wrote the book. But after his mother's death has become like Kaitlyn ... absent. He performed odd jobs in town. Much of this is not earned. And when the bill came, shifting from foot to foot and tugged at her hair ashamed. He behaved like a child, but loved to Kaita, and she his. Never allow anyone to hurt him. 

Now it would leave even before adult to college? I go for the whole year to California ... 

- It's impossible - she repeated. 

Mrs. McCasslan carefully watched her plump hands. 

- But Kaitlyn, do not you think that your father wants you to go? You to do what is best for you? 

Kaitlyn shook her head. She did not want to hear any arguments. Has already decided. 

- Do not you like to learn how to control your skills? - Asked Joyce. Kaitlyn looked at her intently. 

I never thought that it could control. The drawings have appeared in the least expected moment, took over power in its hands, and she seemed not even aware of it. I never knew that something had happened, until I finished drawing. 

- I think you learn it - Joyce claimed. -I think the time is mogłybyśmy 

to teach. 

Kaitlyn opened her mouth, but before she could say anything, outside there was a

terrible noise. 

Thud, screech and bang, all at once. The noise was so deafening that Kaitlyn immediately thought that something extraordinary happened. And this is somewhere very close. Joyce and Mrs. McCasslan jumped, but the director first caught the door. She ran out into the street, and Kaita and Joyce moved behind her. 

People were milling around on both sides of Harding Street, crushing snow boots. Cold air in your cheeks pinched Kaitlyn. Glow of the setting sun created a sharp contrast between light and shadow, and the image that she saw Kaitlyn, seemed to be very focused and clear. 

Neon yellow car brand was on the street. The rear wheel was on the sidewalk, and left the door was completely Dented. Apparently was hit in the side and he turned. Kaitlyn recognized the car. He belonged to Jerry Crutchfield, one of the few students who had a car. 

In the middle of the street, in front of Kaitlyn, dark blue station wagon stopped. Front of the car was completely removed, the metal twisted and deformed, and broken headlights. Polly Vertanen, junior class student, she continued Mrs. McCasslan sleeve. 

- Everything I saw, Ms. McCasslan. Jerry was leaving the parking lot, But that combo so rushed. Simply hit him ... Was going too fast. 

- This car Marian Gunter! - Cried Mrs. McCasslan. - And in the middle is her little daughter. Do not touch her! 

Do not touch! - Director went on, but Kaita no longer hear it. She stared at the windshield combo. Previously did not notice anything. Gathered around the people began to scream and run in different directions. Kaitlyn was speechless. Her whole world focused on the windscreen. 

The little girl was struck by the glass, or maybe it flew at her window. Forehead touching the window, looked like outside. 

She had her eyes wide open. Large, round eyes with long eyelashes. As with deer Bambi. Upturned nose and rounded chin, and her curly blond hair stuck to the glass. Glass looked like cobwebs. Gossamer glued to the face. 

- Oh no, please do not ... - Kaitlyn whispered. 

She felt that she grabbed onto something, but did not know what. Someone it 

maintained. 

In the distance we could hear sirens approaching. Around the car to a large crowd gathered, obscuring the view of the child Kaitlyn. 

She knew Curt Gunther. It had to be Linda, his little sister. Kaita Why not guessed? Why do not figure suggested? Why do not you drew colliding cars, bearing a specific date and place, rather than face the unhappy child? Why it was all completely useless, so damn useless ...? 

- You want to sit down? - Asked the person I was holding her. It was Joyce Piper. Kaita shaking. She was breathing very quickly, and even harder grabbed Joyce. 

- You said seriously that I could control ... what I do? - Kaita was unable to call 

talent. 

Joyce looked at her, and then shifted his gaze to smashed cars. On its face appeared to understand. 

- Wallflower I think, I hope lacquer. 

- But you must promise me. 

Joyce looked her straight in the eye in the manner in which the thoroughfare nobody laughed at her 

to look. 

- I promise I'll try, Kaita. 

- In that case, I am going. My father will understand. Joyce's eyes glistened aquamarines. 

- Lak happy. - He walked her violent shudder. - Twenty degrees, Kaita - she added softly, almost absently. - Do not pack too many things. 

That night, Kaitlyn had a strangely realistic dream. Standing on a rocky promontory surrounded by a small spit a cold, gray ocean. The clouds above her head was almost black, and the wind opryskiwał her face with water. Almost felt around the prevailing moisture and coolness. Suddenly she heard someone behind shouted her name, but when she turned, the dream is over. 

Chapter 3 

W hen Kaita came out of the plane, she was spinning in my head, but she was happy. I've never flew an airplane, and it turned out that this piece of cake. For takeoff and landing, and chewed gum every hour gimnastykowała a tiny toilet to a kick-start. When the plane commuted to the sleeves, her hair and smoothed her hair red dress. Perfectly. She was very happy. As has already decided to leave, I immediately felt better. Expedition to the Institute ceased to be a sad necessity, and became a dream, which she said Joyce. The beginning of her new life. Father behaved beautifully and was very understanding. Escorted her to the airport even if it actually chose to study. Joyce had to wait for her in San Francisco. 

At the airport, however, was crowded and there was no trace of Joyce, and around przewijały the herds of people. Kaitlyn stood near the gate with his head raised high, trying to look nonchalant. She did not want anyone approached her and asked if I needed help. 

- I'm sorry. 

Kaitlyn glanced sideways in the direction whence came the stranger's voice. But it was not a suggestion of help, but something much worse. Before her stood a sectarian, of the kind that spin 

through the airport and ask for money. He was wearing a strange red robes. Tuscan red, she thought, Kaitlyn, in case one day she wanted to paint it. 

- Could I take you a minute? - His voice was polite, but insistent, seemed even overbearing. The man spoke with a foreign accent. 

Kaita tried to withdraw, but he grabbed her hand. Amazed she looked down. Slender fingers tightened on her wrist. 

Okay, asshole, I wanted it. The rage directed at him all the power of his dark blue eyes surrounded by mysterious ringed. But the man looked at her calmly, and when Kaita looked deeply into his eyes, until 

staggered backward. 

He had caramel skin and slanted eyes and very dark, with a wrinkle nakątną. Looking at him, Kaitlyn immediately came to mind the term "penetrating gaze". He

slightly curly hair in a shade of light brown. Nothing to himself did not fit. But it's not ścięło her feet, and feeling that he was very old. In his eyes, saw the intervening centuries. Millennium. 

Kaita did not remember that ever really cried in my life, but this time decided to do it. 

She had no chance. The man even more squeezed her wrist, and before she could take 

the next breath, lost her balance. The guy in strange clothes dragged her back into the corridor that led straight to the aircraft. 

Except that now there was no plane, and the deserted corridor. Double doors closed, cutting off from the rest of the airport Kaitlyn. Was still too shocked to scream. 

- Do not move, it will not do you no wrong - the man hissed, staring hard at her eyes. 

Kaitlyn did not believe him. Aliens belonged to a sect, and was apparently in the belfry. Enlisted her in a completely deserted after the place. She should have been attacking him and screaming, when I had the opportunity. It was in the trap. Not letting go of her hand, the man began to search for something under clothing. Probably a gun or a knife, she thought Kaitlyn, and her heart was pounding like mad. Had it for a moment he let go, if it could get to the other side of the door, where there were other people ... 

- Please - said the man. - I just want you looked at it. Do not hold the gun, but only a piece of paper. Glossy, folded paper. Kaitlyn thought it was a flyer. I can not believe she thought. It's really crazy. 

- 'Just look - the man repeated. 

Kaitlyn did not exit, the guy waving the piece in front of the nose. She saw the rose garden color photo. Was surrounded by a garden wall, and at the middle stood a fountain, from which something bursting. Maybe an ice sculpture of some sort, she thought Kaitlyn stunned. Fountain was a tall, white and almost transparent as a column of facets. On one of the many facets reflected a tiny rose. 

Heart still pounding her with all my strength. It was all too weird. And scary, like a stranger really tried to hurt her. 

- The crystal ... - He began, and then Kaitlyn saw his chance. Male iron grip loosened slightly and his eyes focused on photography. Then Kaitlyn with full force kicked him happy, 

that wearing high-heeled boots and pierced him in the calf pięciocentymetrową pin. The guy screamed and let go of it. 

Kaitlyn rushed to the door and rushed straight to the airport. And then she began to run, not looking back. Skirted chairs and telephones hanging on the walls and blindly guided by the crowd assembled in the hall. 

She stopped only when she heard someone calling her name. 

- Kaitlyn! 

It was Joyce, who went to the gate. Kaita had never felt such relief at someone's view. 

- Excuse me, were terrible traffic jams and parking in this place borders on a miracle ... - Joyce stopped. - What happened? 

Kaitlyn fell into her arms. Now, when she was safe, wanted her to laugh. That's probably hysteria. Her legs were shaking. 

- It's strange - wydusiła. - Lam was a guy with a sect or something like that. He grabbed me. Sure he wanted money, but I thought ... 

- How does it grab you? Where is it? Kaitlyn waved his hand distractedly. 

- Somewhere out there. I kicked him and ran away. Joyce's eyes flashed aquamarines of satisfaction, but said only: 

- Let's go. We should report it to protect the airport. 

- Oh, but I feel better already. It was a madman ... 

- Such mental closes. Even in California - Joyce replied firmly. Protecting sent several men in search of a man, but he disappeared without a trace. 

- Besides - the guard told them - could not open the door into the next corridor. All the time they are closed. 

Kaitlyn did not want to argue. She preferred to forget and go to the Institute. Not that she imagined her first day, California,. 

- Let's go already. - Joyce pulled by the hand. 

The girl sighed and nodded. 

Kaitlyn took away our luggage and went toward the little green convertible. When I started, Kaita she wanted to jump on the chair. At home there was frost on the ground and lay fifty inches of snow. And here rode with the top down and the wind blew fair hair Joyce. 

- How is the little girl from an accident? - Asked Joyce. Kaitlyn liquid contacts a good mood like a soap bubble. 

- It is still in the hospital. Nobody knows whether it will pan out. - Kaitlyn pursed her lips as if trying to make it clear that there is no intention to talk about Linda. But Joyce is not asking more questions. Instead, she said: 

- The Institute is already three of your roommates. Lewis and Anna. I think they'll like. Lewis - a boy. 

- How many will be boys? - Kaitlyn asked suspiciously. 

- I am afraid that the three - Joyce replied grimly, sending Kaita amused look. But Kaitlyn was not amused. Three boys and one girl only. Three sloppy, uncontrolled hormones and shot Power Rangers. Kaitlyn has already tried once to ask the guys. About two years ago, when she was in second grade. She let one of them take on the dating of Lake Erie in every Friday and Saturday evening. Even hated his stupid courtship, at least within certain limits, and he told her about Metallica, Brownsach, Bengalsach and red Trans Am cars. That is about everything, which did not have the faintest idea. After a first date stated that the guys are a strange species, however, and stopped to listen. All the time she was hoping that eventually it will invite to a party with his crew. Everything was planned in detail. Take her to one of those big houses on the hills, which had never been invited. Włożyłaby something 

loose, but not too much, so as not to offend the hostess. He will cover her, and she will behave modestly. Everyone would have the opportunity to see for yourself that is not a monster. Pozwoliliby her come to your world, maybe not immediately, but sooner or later przyzwyczailiby to her company. 

Not really. 

As soon as I mentioned the event, her lover of the lakes began to shoot something. But in the end the truth came out. He had no intention to take her in any public place. Well checked on trips to the lake, but it was not good enough to show her in the company. 

It was one of those rare situations where it was difficult to stop the tears. She pursed her lips and told to drive home. All the way the boy was doing more and more furious. Until the end with a bang opened her door and hissed: 

- And so you had to quit. You are not like normal girls-are frigid. Kaita stared for departing car. So I was insane, great. This is just knew. And frigid. From the manner in which it is said, guessed that it was not about her character. He meant something more. 

Great. Now prefers to be alone all his life, than anything to live with this guy. At the mere mention of his wet hands on his shoulders would like to wipe your hands on a red dress. 

So I'm frigid, she thought Kaita, drilling on the front seat of a convertible. And so what? In life there are many other interesting things. 

Besides, had somewhere, clay guys will be at the Institute. It will ignore them and keep 

close to Anna. Anna May was not only crazy about guys. And may you liked, he added, quiet, insistent voice inside her head. Kaitlyn suppressed this thought, and allowed to wind ruffled her hair. Enjoyed the ride and the sun. 

- Are We There Yet? - She asked. - I can not wait. Joyce laughed. 

- No, not far off. 

It rode on residential streets. Kaitlyn looked around eagerly, but with a slight feeling of unease. And if the Institute is too big, too sterile and intimidating? She imagined huge, squat red brick building, similar to her school in the thoroughfare. 

Joyce entered the driveway, and looked incredulously Kaita around. 

- It's here? 

- Oh. 

- But this building is purple. 

And that's how. The walls were cool shade of violet, wood trim around the windows were deep-purple, and the doors and balconies - jaskrawofioletowe. An exception were the gray beveled roof and chimney. 

Kaita felt as if someone threw her into a pool filled with dark grape juice. She was not sure whether the color she likes it or not. 

* The Browns, The Bengalł - professional American football team (-handedly.). 

- We have not had time to paint it - Joyce explained by parking the car. - We were too busy transforming the ground floor in the laboratory. Tomorrow will see the entire building. Maybe now you go to greet with their roommates? 

Kaita felt the anxiety overwhelmed her. The Institute was much smaller and more cozy than 

she imagined. Really going to live here and it is with strangers. 

- Yeah, great. - She raised up her head and got out of the car. 

- Skip the now head of suitcases and go inside. Go through the room, and on the right are stairs. 

Go to the top, the whole floor is for you. Lewis and Annie told you to split themselves 

rooms. 

Kaitlyn moved forward. She did not want to either procrastinate or hurry. She did not want it to anybody noticed how very nervous. Purple door was open. Fortunately, the interior of the house was a different color and it looked quite ordinary. On the right side was 

has a large lounge and large dining room on the left. 

Do not look at it now. Go to the top. 

Kaitlyn went through a corridor lined with glazed tiles, which separated the two rooms, and found herself on the stairs. Only slowly, breathe calmly. But her heart was pounding with all his might, and burst themselves feet upwards. Zakręcały stairs on the landing, and suddenly found itself on the 

the top. 

The corridor was full of different nonmatching to each equipment. Kaita noticed the open door, and inside she heard voices. 

Okay, who cares if they are nice? Perhaps it is some palanty, I do not care. I do not need anyone. Can I learn to cast spells on people? 

At the last moment, however, panic gripped her and fell through the open door in a fighting mood. 

She stopped in her tracks. On the empty bed, knelt a girl. Beautiful, graceful, dark, with high cheekbones and a peaceful expression. Kaitlyn militant attitude melted away like the mist, and the walls, which are usually built around him, collapsed. Since the girls struck an unusual calmness, which resembled the cold wind. The stranger smiled. 

- You're probably Kaitlyn. 

- And you ... Anna? 

- Anna Eva Whiteraven. 

- What a wonderful name - said Kaitlyn. 

The school name is not Warren G. Harding was said in this way, but Kaitlyn was no longer 

in your school. On the face of Anna's quiet smile appeared. 

- And you have wonderful eyes - she added. 

- Really? - Heard the excited voice of someone else's. -Hey, turn around. Kaita reversed. Across the room there was a recess with a window, which just came out a boy. He did not look threatening. He had black hair and dark almond eyes. In the hands holding the camera and Kaitlyn guessed that it was taking pictures through an open window. 

- Smile! - Kaitlyn blinding flash of the camera. 

- Au! 

- Sorry, I just wanted to capture that moment. -The boy let go of the hands of the camera, which hung suspended on a ribbon around his neck, and stretched out his hand. - But the cool eyes. Some 

strange. My name is Lewis Chao. 

He had such a sweet face, she decided Kaitlyn. Was not great nor terrible, but rather a small and neat. His hand was sweaty, and hungry eyes. 

- Lewis from the morning taking pictures since I arrived - Anna explained. - Already immortalized 

unless the entire district. 

Kaitlyn blinked to get rid of mroczków, looked curiously at Lewis. 

- Really? Where are you from? - Probably even further than he came from Ohio, she thought. The boy grinned. 

- From San Francisco. 

Kaitlyn laughed and after a while we all laughed. And it was not a malicious laugh, but a wonderful, wonderful giggle. I already knew Kaita. 

I'll be happy here, she thought. It was too good to be true. And it will be happy throughout the year. The head appeared to her the image: sitting by the fireside, who noted at the bottom, and do homework. The others are busy with their own affairs, but they share a warm sense of community, although everyone is doing something else. Everyone is different, but do not pay any attention. 

They do not have to build walls. 

They began to talk eagerly, more and more feeling for each other affection. Kaita joined by Anna, who was sitting on the bed. It was natural. 

- I'm from Ohio - she Kaita. 

- Oh, Buckeye * - Lewis interjected. 

- And I am from Washington state - said Anna. - From the Puget Sound area. 

- You are of Indian origin, is not it? 

- Yes, from the tribe Suąuamish. 

- She talks to the animals - added Lewis 

- I do not talk with them - deny Anna softly. - Sometimes I can make to get something done. This kind of projection of thought, says Joyce. 

The projection of thoughts and animals? A few weeks ago, Kaita would say that is nonsense, but after 

its own "gift" it was something incomprehensible. If it were possible, something else also. 

- And I deals with PK - said Lewis. - Psychokinesis. Superiority of mind over matter. 

- How to ... bending spoons? - Kaita asked hesitantly. 

- No, an ordinary spoon bending trick. True psychokinesis applies to very small things, like moving the needle on the compass. And what are you doing? Kaitlyn's heart came up into my throat. I have never said this out loud yet. 

- I ... Actually, I can predict the future. I mean, not me, and my drawings, and when I look at them later, I see that it was meant to be. But usually only after it is 

already happening - ended without rhyme or reason. 

Lewis and Anna deeply zamyślili. 

- Super - finally said Lewis. 

- So you're an artist? - Added Anna. 

Kaitlyn felt great relief, then embraced her euphoria. 

- I guess I just like to draw. 

And now I would gladly drew something, she thought, unable to wait to reach for his pastels. Anna narysowałaby with roasted umber, matt black and sjeny. A Lewis granatowoczarną crayon and some in the shade of skin. 

Later, she told herself. But the voice added: 

- So what do we do with the rooms? Who sleeps where? 

* Ohio is often referred to as the Buckeye State, due to the prevalence of chestnut trees {Buckeye), and its inhabitants called the Buckeyes (-handedly.). 

- I wondered about it - said Anna. -The problem is that the five of us, and there are only four rooms. The one where we are, next to a larger and two smaller ones on the back of the house. 

- A large rooms only have access to cable TV. I explained it already - Lewis sighed with tragic mien - that I have access to MTVJ but she does not understand. Besides, I have 

somewhere to connect your computer and a tower. And only large rooms have adequate exits. 

- We can not take the best rest rooms before arrival - Anna said calmly, but firmly. 

- But I have to have MTV otherwise die. 

- I do not need cable TV - she said Kaitlyn. - But I would like to have a room with northern light, like in the morning draw. 

- I have not heard the worst. Every room is different - he explained Lewis. - Room next door is huge with a huge bed, a balcony and a Jacuzzi. This has a cavity and a separate bathroom, but there is no closet. And the other two have a lot of closets, but it is common 

a bathroom. 

- It seems that the biggest room will get those who will live together, because the two of us have time to sleep - she said Kaitlyn. 

- Great. I can live with either of you - quickly threw Lewis. 

- Oh, no, no, no. Wait, I'll see the light in small rooms - Kaitlyn said, jumping out of bed. 

- Make it better jacuzzi! - Lewis shouted after her. Kaitlyn laughed, glancing over his shoulder, and suddenly fell on someone who stood on top of the stairs. The collision was not strong, but Kaitlyn in reflexively drew back and struck his foot against something hard. She felt a sharp pain in his knee and was speechless for a moment. Clenched teeth and with rage 

looked at what it struck. Bedside cabinet, with drawers pulled out with sharp edges. What do these all the furniture in general were doing in the hallway? 

- I'm sorry. - She heard the quiet southern accent. - Are you okay? Kaitlyn glanced at the tanned, blond boy who fell on her. It was 

Of course the boy. And that big, not small and safe as Lewis. Of the species of those who were doing a lot of confusion around him. Filled the entire hall with his person and was very masculine. If Anna resembled a cold wind, then this here was like a solar torch. Not really able to ignore it, so decided to paralyze him with her eyes. The boy calmly returned the look, and Kaitlyn discovered with amazement that his eyes were amber hue, a few tones darker than his hair. 

- Something you hurt - he said. Apparently confused her electrifying gaze with an expression of suffering. 

- In which place? 

And then did something completely zbiło her off guard. He fell on his knees before her. Oh, he probably wants me to apologize, she thought in despair. God, in California are the same crazies. 

But her boyfriend has not apologized. He reached out and gently touched her legs. 

- Lutaj, right? - He asked with a polite southern accent. 

Kaitlyn opened her mouth, but was unable to say anything, he could only watch. Was propped against the wall and she had nowhere to escape. 

- At this point, right? -1 Without any ceremony, rolled up her red dress. Kaitlyn was shocked. In no way was prepared for this situation: some strange guy looked under her dress, and this in a public place. Besides, it was about how he did. Do not like someone horny, but how ... as ... doctor examining a patient. 

- I myself do not rozcięłaś, only to uderzyłaś - he said. He did not look either at her or on her leg, but the corridor. His fingers gently touched a painful place, if judged 

the damage. Seemed to be dry, but warm, unusually warm. 

- If so, you leave, you'll have a terrible bruise. Do not move for a while, it'll help you out, okay? 

This meant that finally broke the silence Kaita. 

- I will not move? Why? He waved his hand only. 

- Please, do not say anything. Kaitlyn was shocked. 

- Yes - boy whispered, as if speaking to himself. - I think I can help you. I'll try. Kaitlyn wmurowało, was completely paralyzed. She felt his fingers on his knee, in a very intimate, delicate and very sensitive spot. Do not remember anyone touched her there, even a real doctor. 

After a moment, his touch has changed, and Kaitlyn felt a burning and tingling, as in burns. It was almost painful, but ... 

- What are you doing? Stop what you're doing? - Gasped Kaita 

The boy said a quiet voice, without raising her eyes: 

- Redirecting energy. At least I try. 

- I said, stop it ... Oh. 

- Help me now. Do not fight with me. 

Kaitlyn looked at the top of his head. His hair was tousled jasnozłote, and unruly locks stuck on different pages. 

Suddenly something weird pierced her body, reaching to every blood vessel. She felt invigorated and renewed. Drank like a clean, cool water or immersed in the wonderful cold fog. 

The boy began to make an uncontrolled gestures, as if strzepywał something from her knees. Touched and strzepywał. Touched and strzepywał. As if to collect something, and then gently threw 

drops of water from the fingers. 

Kaitlyn suddenly realized that the pain subsided. 

- And on - said the boy cheerfully. - Just shut it ... - The warm hand took her knee. -1 Already. You should not have a bruise. 

He stood up and rubbed his hands. He was breathing so hard, if he had just finished a race. Kaitlyn looked at him intently. Sam was ready to take part in the race. I have never been so lively. But once again glanced at his face, she felt that she should sit down. 

When looked at her, expecting ... Actually, she did not know what. But certainly not fast, absent-minded smile that sent her. The boy turned and was about to leave. 

- I'm sorry for what happened. I better go and I'll help Joyce with suitcases before someone poturbuję again. - I began to descend the stairs. 

- Wait, who are you? I. .. 

- My name is Rob. - He smiled over his shoulder. - Rob Kessler. He reached the platform, turned and disappeared. 

- .. . How did you do? - Kaita threw into the air. Rob. Rob Kessler, she thought. 

- Hey, Kaitlyn! - She heard the voice of peace Lewis. - Are you there? Kaitlyn, come here quick! 

Chapter 4 

Kaitlyn hesitated, still gazing at the stairs. Finally, she took a grip and slowly moved back to the room. Lewis and Anna steel in the bay and looked out the window. 

- It is - an excited voice, Lewis said, lifting up the camera. - That must be it! 

- Who is that? - Kaitlyn asked. She hoped that no one will it be too closely watched. She felt that he had on his face flushed. 

- Mr. Zetes - Lewis said. - Joyce said that the limousine ride. Before the house was black limousine, and her back door was open. Was based on no man with white hair, wearing a long coat. Kaitlyn thought that it must be 

terribly hot in the warm California afternoon. In his hand he held a stick with a gold handle. The real cane with a gold handle, she thought, fascinated by Kaitlyn.

- It seems that he brought his friends - she added with a smile, Anna. The limo jumped two big black dogs. He immediately set off towards the bushes, but as soon as the man he called them, came back into place and stood by his side. 

- Charming - Kaitlyn said. - And then what? 

On the driveway just entered white van with the words "Department of Juvenile." Lewis put the camera on. He was clearly fascinated. 

- Wow, this California Department of Corrections. 

- So ...? 

- This is the last stop. There really naughty boys pack. Hardcore'owców, which can not cope in ordinary poprawczakach. 

- Do you want to say that this prison? - Anna asked softly. 

- My father says it's a place for those who then will go to a regular state prison. You know, murderers and such. 

- Murderers! - Shouted Kaita. - It's what the van doing here? Do not think, unless ... - She looked at Anna, who watched her with a cloudy look on his face. Apparently this is how she thought Anna. 

Both zerknęły on Lewis. His almond-shaped eyes suddenly grew huge. 

- I think we should go there - Kaitlyn said. Quickly ran downstairs and came out on the wooden porch, 

trying not to throw in his eyes. And so no one paid them any attention. Mr. Zetes talked to the guard dressed in a khaki uniform. 

Kaitlyn was able to hear only a few words: 

- Decision of Judge Baldwin, branch, and rehabilitation for minors. 

- ... It's your responsibility - ended guard, moving away from the door of the van. The car got a boyfriend. Kaitlyn raised her eyebrows up. 

He was incredibly handsome, but his face and gestures expressed the cool reserve. He had dark hair and eyes, but his skin was pale. This is one of the few people in California that is not tanned, she thought Kaitlyn. 

-Chiaroscuro, muttered under his breath. 

- What is it? - Whispered Lewis. 

- This word art. It means "chiaroscuro" as in black and white drawing. - When she finished, she felt that the whole trembles. This guy was something strange, as if ... As if was not quite normal, suggested her mind. So they said about you , in your town, right? 

The van drove off. Mr. Zetes and the dark-haired boy came to the door. 

- It seems that we have a new roommate - Lewis muttered under his breath. - Oh boy. Mr. Zetes nodded to the group standing on the porch. 

- I see you already are. I think everyone has already arrived. Go to the center, we will be able to say hello. - A man walked into the building, followed by the dogs. Rottweilers, noted Knillyn. I looked scary. 

When the boy stepped closer, Anna, and Lewis withdrew without a word, but Kaitlyn did not budge. She knew how it is when people are retreating to your view. The boy underwent right 

beside her and turned her head to look her straight in the eye. Kaitlyn noticed that his eyes were not black, but dark. She had the impression that it would arouse anxiety, forced to gaze lowered. 

I wonder what did he do that landed in jail, she thought, and got goose bumps. She went into the building. 

- Mr. Zetes! - Joyce cried joyfully, leaving the living room. She took an old man by the arm and began to tell him something, smiling and gesturing with enthusiasm. Kaitlyn suddenly noticed the stairs someone's bright hair. It was Rob Kessler, who was holding a bag on his shoulder. Her bag. He moved in their direction ... But suddenly stopped. The entire stiffened. Kaitlyn followed his gaze and looked at the newcomer in a boyfriend. 

Strangers, too, was tense. The gray eyes focused on Robie. In his eyes was hidden icy hatred. It looked as if preparing to attack. 

One of the rottweilers Mr. Zetes started to growl. 

- Good boy - he mumbled nervously Lewis. 

- It's you - said the new boy. 

- It's you - repeated Rob. 

- You know it? - Kaitlyn asked. 

The first said Rob, not taking his eyes from the pale, distrustful face the intruder. 

- Yes, from ancient times. - He threw the bag on the ground. 

- Not quite old - said the second boy. In contrast to the soft southern accent, Rob, his voice seemed to be rough and edgy. 

Now, both dogs have barked. 

I guess we can forget about a nice atmosphere, Kaitlyn thought. She noted that Mr. Zetes and Joyce stopped talking and looked at them with attention. 

- It seems that we are all - Mr. Zetes said dryly. 

- Come here - added Joyce. - The long waited for this moment. Rob and new boy slowly turned away from each eye. Joyce gave them a wonderful smile and her eyes glistened aquamarines. 

- Kids, is for me a real honor and pleasure to introduce to you the man who brought you here. Man, who is responsible for the entire project. I present to you Mr. Zetes. 

For a while Kaitlyn wondered if should not start to applaud. Instead, he murmured with others: "Good morning." Nodded Mr. Zetes, and Joyce continued. 

- Mr. Zetes, here are our soldiers. Anna Whiteraven from Washington state. - An old man gave her his hand, and then everyone else, Joyce are presented. - Lewis Chao from California. Kaitlyn Fairchild from Ohio. Rob Kessler of North Carolina. And Gabriel Wolfe z. .. away and out of the blue. 

- Lakes, depends on where the proceedings have been instituted. - Rob syllables linger. Mr. Zetes pierced him with her eyes. 

- Gabriel was paroled and now is under my care - he said. - Able to walk to school, but beyond that he must not leave the house. Knows what 

happen if you violate these rules, is not it, Gabriel? 

The boy moved with his eyes on Mr. Zetes Rob. 

- Yes - said dispassionate voice. 

- Ideal. - Mr. Zetes watched the whole group. -I want you to come to an agreement. I do not know if you realize that you have a great gift. You have the wisest and best use your skills. 

Now just start saying, she thought Kaita, watching carefully to Mr. Zetesowi. He had an impressive white hair, handsome, gray face and broad, kindly face. Kaitlyn suddenly realized who resembled her. It looked like Little Lord * grandfather, the Earl. 

But Mr. Earl gave no ordinary speech. 

- One thing you have to understand right away. You are different from the rest of society. You were ... elected. Stigmatized. You will never be such, as other people, so do not even try. Follow different rules. Kaitlyn frowned. Joyce said similar things, but the words of Mr. Zetes sounded somehow different. She was not sure if that answered her tone. 

- Do you have something, which can not be reduced. Hidden power that burns in you like a fire - he went on. - You are better than the rest of society, I never forget. Does he want us schlebić? - Wondered Kaita. Because if so, he does not go. It all sounds ... somehow empty. 

- You are the pioneers in the expedition, which carries with it an infinite number of possibilities. The work that the execution here, you may change the attitude to the supernatural world, can change the whole of humanity. You young, you can work for the good of others. Kaitlyn suddenly felt an extraordinary desire to draw something. 

This time it was not a whim as usual when it occurred to desire to draw 

Anna and Lewis. Her hand began to itch and she felt her shudder as it passes, and that meant a premonition. 

But the tale could not just go out, when you spoke Zetes. She looked around the room and gaze encountered Gabriel. 

His eyes looked dark and cruel, as if Mr. Zetes question amused him very much, and in a particularly cynical way. 

Kaitlyn with amazement discovered that Gabriel looked as if he did not believe in the words of Mr. Zetes. I looked at her as if they guessed that she thinks the same. She felt a blush. Quickly shifted his gaze to the speaker, taking interested and respectful expression. In the end he paid for her scholarship. Maybe I was a bit eccentric, but apparently had a good heart. When he finished speaking, Kaitlyn did not feel no need to draw. After you Zetesie Joyce spoke, asking them to the next year they gave their all. 

- I'll be with you live, here at the Institute - she added. - My room is there. - Stated the glass door at the rear of the living room that looked as if they led somewhere outside. - You come to me whenever you want, day or night. Oh, and there is one person with whom you work. 

* Little Lord (Originally Little Lord Fauntleroy) - novel by English writer Frances Hodgson Burnett (-handedly.). 

Kaitlyn turned and saw a girl coming out of the dining room. She looked at student

and the storm had mahogany hair and full lips slightly gloomy. 

- It's Marisol Diaz, a student at Stanford - Joyce informed them. - Do not live with us, but it will come every day to help me with the experiments. It will also 

boil. On the wall in the dining room you will find meal times, and tomorrow we'll talk about other conditions prevailing in the home. Do you have any questions? 

Everyone shook their heads. 

- Good. Go to the top now and seize the rooms? It was a long day and I know that some people are tired after traveling by plane. Marisol and I will do a dinner. Kaitlyn was tired. Although her watch showed just Seventeenth forty-five, in Ohio it was already three hours later. Mr. Zetes said goodbye, giving each hand. Then they all went upstairs. 

- And what do you think about it? - She asked in a whisper Lewis and Anna, when they found themselves on the floor. 

- It is impressive, but it is a little scary. If they belonged to the family of Adams - whispered 

Lewis. 

-These dogs were interesting - added Anna. - Usually I can unscramble the animals, to say whether they are happy, sad, or whatever. But these were very well protected. I would not even try to work with them. 

Kaita glanced over his shoulder and noticed that Gabriel is looking at her. She felt uncomfortable, so he proceeded to attack. 

- And what do you think? - She asked him. 

- I think he wants to use us for their own purposes. 

- Use, but how? - Kaitlyn inquired sharply. Gabriel shrugged. 

- How do I know? Maybe he wants to improve your business image, something like "Silicon Valley company working for the good of mankind." How Chevron, which finances programs for the protection of animals. Of course, the one thing we have to admit he was right, we're better than the rest of society. 

- And some of us are better than others, eh? - Rob asked, going up the stairs. - I do not have to follow any rules. 

- Exactly - Gabriel responded with an icy smile. 

He walked down the corridor and in turn looked to all rooms. 

- Well, Joyce said, we chose the rooms. I think I will choose ... this. 

- Hey! - Cried Lewis. - This is the largest, has cable TV and whirlpool, i. .. 

- Thanks for the information - said Gabriel dispassionate voice. 

- This room is larger than the others - said Anna quietly but firmly. - I think it should stay in two. 

- You can not it just a deal - added Lewis. -Although we should vote. Gabriel narrowed his gray eyes, and twisted his mouth grimace. He took a step forward and stood next to 

against Lewis. 

- You know what it looks like a prison cell? - Asked a cold, aggressive voice. - It has a bed with a width of two feet and a metal toilet. One stool attached to a wall and a tiny desk. That's all. I lived in such a cell for the past two years, with short breaks. So I think I'm right. You want to do something about it? Lewis scratched his nose, as if he wondered about it. But Anna pulled him back. 

- MTV is not worth it - she said. Gabriel glanced at Rob. 

- And you, chłoptasiu? 

- I'm not going to beat you, if you mean 

- Said Rob. He looked at Gabriel with a mixture of disgust and pity. - Go ahead, take 

the room itself, you pathetic bastard. 

Lewis gave a silent groan of protest. Gabriel came to her new room and began 

close the door. 

- And by the way - he threw, turning in their direction 

- Let no one dares to enter. After such a long time in the cell, a man wants to have 

little space for themselves. It's getting possessive. I do not want to become someone 

harm. 

When closed the door, threw Kai t: 

- Gabriel, like the angel? - She could hear the sarcasm in his own voice. The door opened again and Gabriel threw her lingering gaze. And then he sent her a wonderful, disturbing smile. 

- Y can fall into when you want - he said. This time the doors closed for good. 

- Something like - outraged Kaitlyn. 

- Christ - added Lewis. Anna just shook her head. 

- Gabriel Wolfe. But he did not behave like a wolf because wolves are very social. The 

except those that were banished from the herd. If you are driven out too far, they start freaking out and attack anyone who comes to them Buiy. 

- I wonder what he can - Kaitlyn wondered. She looked at Rob. But he only shook his head. 

- I do not know. I met him in North Carolina, at Durham. There is also a similar center. 

- Just one? - Lewis looked surprised. 

- Yes. My parents took me there, they thought that someone finally explain to them what was happening to me. His parents probably thought the same. But he did not want to cooperate. He wanted to do 

everything their own way, not counting the other. I ended up in that hurt some 

girl ... 

Kaita watched him closely. She wanted to ask, "How does it hurt?", But seeing his face jammed, no thought to her whatever he said. 

- It was more than three years ago - explained Rob. - After what has happened, Gabriel escaped from the facility. I heard that he wandered from state to state, falling into more and more trouble. Or rather, causing more and more trouble. 

- Well - he threw Lewis. - And we have with this guy live under one roof, and that throughout the year. 

Anna carefully looked at Rob 

- And this center has helped you? 

- Sure. They helped me understand what I can do. 

- And what exactly can we do? - Kaitlyn interjected, looking significantly at him and at his 

the leg. 

- Developing a healing - fair-haired boy replied. - Some call it therapeutic touch and other energy transfer. I'm trying to help people. Looking at his calm golden eyes, Kaitlyn felt slightly embarrassed. 

- No doubt - she replied, as if to say "thank you." She did not want to remain aware of what was already happening between them. She felt strangely intimidated both his person and his reaction to it. 

- I think all we do - said Rob .. His smile was contagious, and it was hard to resist. 

- Well, we try to - Anna sighed. 

Kaita glanced at Lewis, who watched him with wide open eyes, but said nothing. She had the impression that, like it did not used their skills to help others. 

- Listen - Lewis began, clearing his throat loudly. - I do not want to change the topic, but ... Can I now choose peace? Because I want to ... 

Rob looked into the room, who pointed to Lewis, then to the other two. He turned and looked at Lewis with the expression on his face telling 'unless you kidding? "Lewis clearly despondent. 

- But it's the last room, which is cable. And I need MTV. Besides, I have 

connect the computer and the tower, i. .. 

- So we can only do one thing - Rob advised. - This will be our common room. In this way, everyone will be able to watch TV, at the bottom there is no TV. 

- But then what do we do? - Asked Lewis. 

- We will share small rooms - briefly said Rob. 

Kaitlyn and Anna looked at each other with a smile. Kaitlyn had nothing against it, to share 

room with Anna. She was even happy, as if it had a sister. Lewis groaned all the time. 

- But what of my stereo and all the rest? It will not fit in that small room, especially since there are two beds, 

- Well - explained Rob implacable voice. - Connect the equipment in the common room. Then we can all listen to music. Come on, we set up, furniture. When Gabriel was in the middle, carefully examined the room, walking back and forth in silent steps. 

He looked at every angle, to the bathroom and wardrobes. The room was large and luxuriously furnished, and a balcony offered the possibility of quick escapes, if it would prove necessary. He liked. 

He threw himself on the huge bed and began to meditate, or whatever it might even like it here. She was of course the girl. With eyes like a witch and her hair like flames. It could be an interesting springboard. 

But I suddenly felt something squeezing him inside. He sprang to his feet and began to walk 

the room. 

He will have to make sure that was just a springboard. This type of girl could prove to be too interesting, and a temptation to get involved ... And it will never happen again. 

Never. Because ... 

Gabriel dismissed the thought of each other. In addition to the girl there was nothing to him 

like it was for a couple of things that he did not like. Kessler. Restriction of his freedom, house arrest. Kessler. This whole stupid project. Kessler. Had he wanted, he could have something to do with it once and for all be it with the head. But then you would have to flee again, and if they caught him, locked him in prison until he would have turned twenty-five. It was not worth it, at least for now. Wait and see if Kessler will be very annoying. This place was quite bearable, and how to survive in the year, will be rich. With such a pile of money will be able to buy freedom, will be able to have everything he wants. Wait and see. And as for the experiments, well, it remains to be seen. Whatever happens, it will be their problem. Their wine. 

He lay down on the bed. It was still early, but he felt tired. After a few minutes longer 

he slept. 

Kaita and her friends did not do too much until Joyce called them for dinner. Kaita liked the idea of ​​eating 

dinner at the big table in the dining room along with five other people. Five, because Gabriel did not come from your room, ignoring the knock at the door. She felt as if it were part of a large family and everyone seemed to have fun. Perhaps with the exception of Marisol, who said nothing at all. 

After dinner they returned to the furnishing of rooms. There was plenty to choose from, in the hallway and rooms gathered a lot of furniture, each in a different style. The room Kaita and Anna were in the end of two mismatched beds, cheap bookcase from pressed wood, a beautiful French-style chair in the province, Victorian desk and a bedside cupboard, the same who earlier attacked Kaita in the corridor. Kaitlyn liked everything. Rob found that the bathroom between small rooms will belong to the girls. 

- Girls like to be close to his stuff - he said mysteriously to Lewis, who just shrugged. The boys had to use the bathroom in the common room. Putting to bed, Kaitlyn feel happy. The moonlight rushed into the room through the window behind her bed. Northern light, happy noticed. Shining directly on a beautiful basket cedrowowiśniowy that Anna put on a shelf, and a raven mask hanging on the wall. Anna breathed calmly, lying on the second bed. 

Kaitlyn seemed to her old life in Ohio was far behind, and was therefore happy. 

Tomorrow, Sunday, she thought. Joyce promised to show us the lab, and then maybe a little 

scratch the. Then look around the city. And on Monday we go to school, and I finally I had friends. 

What a wonderful idea. She knew that Anna and Lewis will want to eat lunch together. She hoped that Rob also to join them. As for Gabriel, they will continue to keep away from them, the better. I do not regret it ... 

Her thoughts began to drift. Slight uneasiness that she felt because of Mr. Zetes, disappeared. Quickly fell asleep. 

But after a while she was fully awake. Above her bed, she bent down a figure. Kaitlyn stopped breathing. She felt that her heart goes into my throat. The moon had disappeared and had not seen the details of form, but only a dark outline. 

For a moment, not knowing why, she thought Rob? Gabriel? 

Suddenly the window fell into a soft light. She saw mahogany halo of hair and full lips Marisol. 

- What happened? - She whispered, sitting down on the bed. - What are you doing here? Marisol eyes resembled two black holes. 

- Watch out or get out of here - she hissed. 

- What is it? 

- Watch out ... or get out of here. You think you're so wise, such gifted, right? Better than others. 

Kaitlyn did not know what to say. 

- But I do not know anything. This place is not like you think. I saw different things here ... - She shook her head and laughed. - It does not matter. Better watch out ... - Suddenly he stopped and looked back. Kaitlyn saw only a dark rectangle door, but it seemed to her that at the bottom of a noise she heard. 

- Marisol, what ... 

- Zaniknij up. I have to go. 

- But ... 

But Marisol already emerged. After a while Kaitlyn's bedroom door closed. 

Chapter 5 

The next morning, Kaita had time to forget about the mysterious visit. He woke her tone distant, and had the impression that it is very late. She glanced at the clock and found that it is the seventh 

thirty, which meant that in Ohio it was already half past eleven. Ringer did not stop ringing and Anna also sat on the bed. 

- Good afternoon - greeted her with a smile. 

- Good morning - said Kaitlyn. It was wonderful to wake up next roommate. - What's that noise? 

Anne tilted her head. 

- I have no idea. 

- I'm going to find out. - Kaitlyn stood up and opened the door to the bathroom. The sound was now much more pronounced and accompanied by screaming strange and mysterious hum. On impulse knocked into the room, and Rob Lewis. 

- Please, go. - She heard the voice of Rob. She opened the door and peered inside. Rob sat on the bed, his tousled blonde hair resembled the lion's mane. From the waist up was naked, she noticed Kaitlyn and passed her shiver. At the other bed lay a pile of blankets, under which most likely was Lewis. 

Kaitlyn suddenly you realized that he was wearing only a nightgown up to the knees. There was resistance to parade it around the house, until faced with reality. Boys were around. 

Desperately looked around the room, searching for sources of noise. I finally found. It was a cow. Porcelain cow with a watch in the abdomen. From the inside coming out 

equal, rough voice that spoke with a distinct Japanese accent: "Get up! There sleeps the whole life! Get up! " 

Kaitlyn looked at talking alarm clock, and then glanced at Rob, whose face appeared 

slow, contagious, a smile, and suddenly everything was in order. 

- It certainly Lewis - Kaite sighed and began to giggle. 

- It's great, is not it? - Under a pile of blankets they heard muffled voice. - I bought it at Sharper Image. 

- So that I can expect from my współlokatorach - Kaita said. - The hum of the morning. - Both! Rob began to laugh, until finally Kaita decided it was time to close the door. 

And then he glanced at his reflection in the mirror. Normally you do not spend too much time in front of a mirror, but at the moment ... 

Her hair was tousled up to the waist, and on his forehead appeared disheveled red curls. Surrounded by the mysterious ringed eyes stared at her with sarcasm. And what, apparently do not care about boys? - They asked. Then why do you think about that next time before they swept into the room, you should at least comb their hair? Kaitlyn quickly moved in the direction of the shower and then remembered a visit Marisol. 

"Watch out or get out ... This place is not like you think ... "God, if this really happened? At this time, it seemed only a dream. Kaitlyn froze in the middle of the bathroom, feeling the joy of leaving her. Is Marisol was crazy? Yes had to have some mental problems. Who had heard the night to sneak into someone's 

beds and scare people. 

She thought that must be to someone talk, but she did not know with whom. If she says Joyce, Marisol can have trouble. Would donosicielką, and what if it was but a dream? In light of the morning sun, hearing the laughter and splashing around the water, could not believe that the warning Marisol be true. That the Institute really has something wrong. When I came down for breakfast, Marisol was in the kitchen, but on inquiring look gloomy silence Kaita said. And when I politely asked Kaita: 

- Marisol, can we talk? 

The girl winced, not lifting his eyes from orange juice. 

- I'm busy. 

- But ... As for last night. 

Expected that Marisol says: "What are you talking about?", Which would mean that, but everything she dreamed. But only Marisol shook her mahogany hair and threw: 

- Oh, for that matter. Do not understand? It was a joke. 

- Joke? 

- Of course - Marisol said curtly. - Do not domyśliłaś it? You, telepaths, you are such dumb sometimes. Zorientowałaś not it? 

Kaitlyn felt that just explode. 

- At least no one sneaks into the night as complete crazies! - She cried. - The next time beware. 

- For what? - Marisol mocked. 

- Because ... see itself! - But at this point, others began to come in for breakfast, so Kaitlyn did not have to invent a particular threat. Only muttered: - psycho. -1 Grabbed the bun. 

All were alive, like the previous evening at dinner. And again, Gabriel did not come. When Joyce told them about the conditions prevailing in the home, and experiments that will do, Kaitlyn forgot about Marisol. 

- This morning we'll do the first series of tests to begin implementation - said Joyce. - But first, who wants to call the parents, can do so now. Kaitlyn, not unless you called yesterday for my dad? 

- No, but now is a good time, thank you - Kaita said, with relief, moving away from the table. When Rob looked at in light of the morning, overwhelmed by her strange feeling. She called the father of the camera, who was standing by the stairs. 

- Having a good time, honey? 

- Yes - Kaitlyn nodded. - Dad, here is warm and not have to put a sweater when I go out. Everyone is very nice, well, 

Ilawa everyone. At least the majority. No matter, I think it would be great. 

- Do you have enough money? 

- Oh, yes. - Kaitlyn knew that before her father wysupłał leaving everything he had. - I'll give you advice. I really do. 

- That's great honey, I miss you. Kaita blinked. 

- I follow you too. I need to finish, I love you. 

In the next room she heard voices. She passed on a small staircase and corridor under the platform saw the open door. All of them were already inside. 

- Enter - encouraged her Joyce. - This is our front lab. Once there was a large room. Then I lead a trip. 

* Sharper Image - an American chain of stores specializing in the sale of modern electronics and gifts (-handedly.). 

The laboratory was completely different than expected Kaita. She imagined white walls, shiny equipment, tiles on the floor and hushed voices. Although there were some equipment, but there also have neat screen, plenty of comfortable chairs and sofas, two bookcases and a tower, from which came the music in the style of New Age. 

- Many years ago, proved in Princeton that is best for a family atmosphere - Joyce explained. - It's as if the observer effect. You know, it is difficult to demonstrate 

supernatural abilities when examined feels uncomfortable. Rear laboratory, which was founded in the place where once was a garage, it was very similar, except that there were metal like a bank safe deposit room. 

- It provides complete isolation room during the experiments - Joyce explained. - It is sound and it can communicate only with headphones. He is also a Faraday cage, stops radio waves, and all electronic communications. How to put someone there, you can be sure that does not use common sense, to get information. 

- I bet - Kaitlyn she mumbled under her breath, feeling that pierces her shiver. The

For some reason the metal room does not like her. - I ... Not unless you want me there, close, huh? 

Joyce glanced at her and laughed. Her eyes glittered on her tanned face. 

- No, at least until you are ready - she said. - You know what, Marisol? - She said to stand for student Kaitlyn. - Bring Gabriel. He goes to the first fire. 

Marisol left. 

- Listen, let's start the show! - Joyce cried gaily. - This is our first day of the experiment, so the atmosphere will be rather informal, but I want you to be 

focussed. I am not asking you to work all the time, but I want you gave it everything. 

She led them to the front lab. Anna and Lewis sat on both sides of the room with something that resembled a normal position to work, except that it was equipped with a mysterious-looking device. Kaitlyn did not hear all the commands, but after a while they both plunged into the work, not paying attention to what is happening around you. 

- Gabriel is coming - Marisol announced, standing in the doorway. - There are also volunteers. On Sunday morning I was able to organize only two. 

Fawn volunteers turned out to be exceptionally beautiful blonde in a wheelchair, and Sid, a boy with a blue mohawk and an earring in his nose. A typical Californian, she thought with appreciation Kaita. Marisol took them to the back of the lab. Joyce Kaita asked to sit on the couch by the window. 

- You will work with Fawn, but the company with Rob - she said. - I think we give him a start, so you could get some rest. 

Kaitlyn had nothing against. She felt both excited and nervous because of the upcoming 

the tests. And if you will not be able to do anything? I have never benefited from his power to call, with the exception of that "eye test" organized by Joyce, but then did not know that uses it. 

- Listen, Rob - Joyce began assuming Fawn finger pressure. - We will do a series of 

six tests, each for five minutes. I want you out of the box took a piece of paper. If the piece is written, "Raise", try to raise her blood pressure. If you will be written 

"Lower", I want you to be dropped. If it says "No change", the machine does not do. Do you understand? 

Rob looked at the Fawn, and then Joyce and frowned. 

- Yes ma'am, but ... 

- Call me Joyce. I'll save the results. Just do not betray what was on the paper, just do what you do. - Joyce glanced at his watch and nodded toward the box. - Take the first 

postcard. 

Rob held out his hand, but then left her. He knelt before the fair-haired girl in a wheelchair. 

- Legs much you tease? 

Fawn Joyce glanced at and then back to Rob. 

- I suffer from multiple sclerosis. Got sick fairly early. Sometimes I can walk, but now it happens to be quite hard. 

- Rob ... - Joyce began. 

But Rob behaved as if it had not heard. 

- You can pick up the leg? 

- Not too high. - Little girl raised her leg and left her. 

- Rob - Joyce repeated. - Nobody expects from you, you ... We can not measure 

something like that?, ' 

- Excuse me - Rob said quietly, not looking back. Then he said 

the Fawn: - And this? You can pick it up? 

- Not as high as the previous one. - Leg lifted a little and fell. 

- Good. Now do not move. You may briefly feel the warmth or cold, but not pay any attention. ¡0 Rob reached out and grabbed the girl's bare ankle. Joyce tilted her head and looked at the ceiling. She sighed and sat down next to Kaitlyn. 

- I was able to guess. - She put aside his watch and notes. Kaitlyn watched Rob. 

He turned his head in her direction, but it was clear that it has not seen. It looked as if he wanted 

something to hear, and his fingers moved nimbly through the ankle Fawn. Kaitlyn, fascinated, watched his face. Regardless of what she thought about boys, her artistic soul it could not be deceived. She remembered the words that once 

read: "A beautiful, honest face with the eyes of a dreamer." And the fierce warrior's jaw, she added mentally, throwing Joyce amused look. 

- And how do you feel? - Rob said Fawn. 

- I ... It tickles a little bit - said the girl with a nervous smile. - Oh! 

- Try to pick up her leg again. 

This time, Fawn rate rose almost twenty five centimeters above the floor. 

- I was able to - she sighed. - No, you did. -She stared at him with large eyes, which were depicted astonishment. 

- Sam did. - Rob smiled. He was breathing very fast. - Now Work on the other. 

Kaitlyn felt a sudden pang of jealousy. 

As in Ohio, when she heard, as Marcy Huang is planning another event. The way in which Rob focused on the Fawn, and Fawn looked at him ... 

Joyce giggled. 

- The same thing I saw him at school - she said softly. - All the girls fainted at the sight, he did not know what was happening. The boy does not have the slightest idea what is sexy. 

That's just it, she thought Kaita. He knows nothing. 

- But why? - Burned. 

- Probably by this, which gave him this gift - said Joyce. - By accident. 

- What accident? 

- You will be remembered? For sure you tell all, if you ask him. He flew the glider and crashed. Broke almost every bone and fell into a coma. 

- Oh my God - she moaned softly Kaita. 

- Nobody expected that it will survive. When he awoke, it was found that has a gift, but also 

various shortcomings. For example, have no idea what's going on with girls. 

- You're kidding. - Kaitlyn stared at her wide-eyed. 

- No. - Joyce smiled. - It is very innocent, and that in many ways. Simply sees the world differently than other people. 

Kaitlyn closed her eyes. Of course, it's because the girls looks so unceremoniously into dresses. It explains everything except why on his view of her heart began to beat faster. And why does it hurt the thought that lay deep in a coma. And why suddenly gripped her nasty temptation to run up and pull him away from the beautiful Fawn. 

There is some word to describe your state, mocked her mind. It ... Shut up, she thought Kaitlyn. But it's possible. Already knew. 

- Enough - said Rob. He sat on his heels and wiped sweat from his forehead. - If we work at it every week, unless I can help you. Would you like to? Fawn said only: 

- Oh, yes. - But in terms of the way she said it, she thought Kaita, and admiring gaze, which he threw. Fortunately, at this point, Joyce got up from the couch. 

- Rob, you may first let's talk - Joyce interjected. 

Rob turned and looked at her soft eyes. 

- I knew that I agree - he replied. 

Joyce muttered something under his breath. And then she added: 

- Sure, work something out. Maybe now you do get a break, huh? Fawn, if you're too tired for another experiment ... 

- Not at all, I feel great - chirped happily Fawn. - I'm ready for anything. 

- Transfer of energy - Joyce muttered, taking off pressure. - We will have to investigate. 

- At this moment the door opened between the two laboratories. - What's going on, Marisol? 

- He does not want to cooperate - Marisol said. Behind her stood Gabriel. He looked 

extremely deadly and elegant in its way, but I looked at them with cold contempt. 

- Why? - Asked Joyce. 

- You know why - answered Gabriel. He must have felt at the sight Kaita, he suddenly threw her long dark eyes. 

Joyce put her hand on his forehead. 

- Okay, we need to talk about it. Rob reached out and grabbed her by the arm. 

- Mrs. ... Joyce, I'm not sure if it's a good idea. You have to be careful ... 

- I'll give you advice, Rob - Joyce assured him in a tone that suggested that he had had enough. She went to a second laboratory, taking with him Marisol and Gabriel, and closed the door behind them. Anna and Lewis watched the scene from their jobs. Even Fawn everything is watched. 

Kaitlyn had the courage and looked closely at the Rob. 

- What is that supposed to mean? - She asked, striving for indifference. 

Rob seemed very thoughtful. 

- I do not know, but I remember what happened in Durham. There he tried to do experiments with him. - He shook his head. - I'll see you later - he said quietly and left. Kaitlyn was happy that he did not turn to look at the Fawn, and inconsolable but that does not even look at her. 

After a few minutes, Joyce returned. She looked finished. 

- What were we? Oh, Kaitlyn, it's your turn. 

Oh no, just not now, she thought Kaitlyn. After the recent discoveries associated with Rob was sore. She wanted to bury myself somewhere alone and consider everything. Joyce absently leafed through a folder. 

- To be informally - muttered under his breath. - Kaitlyn, I want you to sit here. - She took Kaitlyn as a screen, where he was waiting for her plush armchair. - The moment 

I ask you, would you set up the headphones and blindfold over his eyes. - It was a strange band, looked like goggles made of half a tennis ball. 

- What is it? 

- This version of the cover Ganzfeld poor. I am trying to raise money to make a decent room Ganzfeld, with a red light and stereo sound, i. .. 

- Red light? 

- Helps to relax, but it does not matter. The main objective is to cut off the cover you Ganzfeld 

from the ordinary senses, so you can concentrate only on those supernatural. Nothing you see, because the eyes will be sash, and you hear nothing, because you have the headphones on his ears filled with white noise. This will help you see the images that appear 

in your head. 

- But these images do not arise in my head - Kaita said. - Only in my hands. 

- Sure. - Joyce smiled. - Let them come, here is a piece of paper and pencil. You do not have to see to draw. Let the pencil moves as he wants. 

Kaitlyn seemed that it was pure madness, but it was Joyce expert. She sat down and had a band. Around it grew dark. 

- Try with only one image of the target - suggested Joyce. - Fawn will 

focus on the photograph of an object. And you try to find out what they are thinking. 

- Sure - Kaitlyn she mumbled, which would give rise to the earpieces. She heard a noise resembling the sound of a waterfall. It must be the white noise, she thought, based 

comfortably in an armchair. 

She felt, as Joyce puts her hand a pencil, a pad placed on the knees. Okay, relax.

It was not difficult. She knew that no one sees it as a screen. That's good, because I probably looked awfully silly. Was able to pull out and allow thoughts to drift freely. The darkness and the roar of the waterfall was as slippery slide. She felt that pulls down ... do not know where. 

I began to be afraid.
