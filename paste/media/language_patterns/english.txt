Kosciuszko together with Joseph Orlowski, a colleague from the school of chivalry, he went through the support of Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski as a royal scholarship to Paris (France). In Paris he studied at the Academy of Painting and Sculpture. After a while Kosciuszko realized that the career of a painter quite suits him. He wanted to enrich their knowledge of engineering. But he could not think about joining one of the Parisian military school because he was a foreigner and did not have enough money. So he taught himself and went to the lectures of professors from private military schools. The five-year stay in France, Kosciuszko, who was on the eve of the revolution, has had a major influence on his political and social beliefs.
